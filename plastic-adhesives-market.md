<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic adhesives market is primarily categorized into two types: solvent-based and water-based adhesives. Solvent-based adhesives contain organic solvents that facilitate strong bonding by evaporating after application, providing excellent adhesion but potentially releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, water-based adhesives use water as the primary solvent and are often considered more environmentally friendly, offering lower VOC emissions and easier cleanup. Both types cater to various industries, including automotive, packaging, and construction, based on performance and environmental considerations.</p></p>
