<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thebaine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extraction from Poppy Straw</li><li>Extraction from Opium</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thebaine is primarily extracted from two sources: poppy straw and opium. In the extraction from poppy straw, the raw material is processed to isolate thebaine as a byproduct during the production of other alkaloids. This method typically yields lower concentrations. Conversely, in extraction from opium, thebaine is directly obtained from opium latex, providing a more concentrated and higher-quality yield. Both market types play significant roles in the pharmaceutical industry, catering to different production needs and purity levels.</p></p>
